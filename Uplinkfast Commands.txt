Uplink Fast:

- Enabled by default in RSTP.

- Should be configured in access switches.

- After configuring uplink fast, the priority is increased with 49152 and the cost with 3000.

- If the root port is down, the block becomes the root port in no time.

- If the root port is up again after failure, it becomes the root again after 30 sec + skew time which is 5 sec. 



Objectives: 

- Configure uplink fast on IOU3 switch to converge faster from direct change.

- Update the maximum update rate to 100 PPS.
